# ðŸ”„ Workflows & Best Practices

This guide outlines proven workflows for different development scenarios using the Claude Orchestrator. Each workflow includes step-by-step procedures, communication patterns, and quality gates.

## ðŸš€ Project Initialization Workflows

### New Project Startup Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request: "Start Project X"] --> B[Orchestrator Analysis]
    B --> C[Create Tmux Session]
    C --> D[Deploy Project Manager]
    D --> E[PM Analyzes Requirements]
    E --> F[PM Deploys Development Team]
    F --> G[Team Introductions & Planning]
    G --> H[Initial Sprint Planning]
    H --> I[Development Begins]
    I --> J[Regular Check-ins]
```

#### Step-by-Step Process:

**1. Project Request Analysis (Orchestrator)**
```bash
# User says: "Start a new e-commerce project"
# Orchestrator response:
./orchestrator.py start ecommerce-platform /path/to/project --template enterprise-team
```

**2. Session Creation & PM Deployment**
```bash
# Creates: claude-ecommerce-platform session
# Window 0: Project Manager deployed with briefing
```

**3. Project Manager Initial Analysis**
- Reviews project_spec.md if available
- Analyzes project requirements and scope
- Determines optimal team composition
- Creates initial project plan and timeline

**4. Team Deployment (PM Responsibility)**
```bash
# PM deploys based on project needs:
# Window 1: Frontend Developer (if web app)
# Window 2: Backend Developer
# Window 3: QA Engineer
# Window 4: DevOps Engineer (if needed)
```

**5. Team Coordination & Planning**
- PM introduces team members to each other
- Shares project vision and requirements
- Assigns initial tasks and responsibilities
- Establishes communication protocols

### Quick Prototype Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Prototype Request] --> B[Single Developer + PM]
    B --> C[Rapid Implementation]
    C --> D[Quick Testing]
    D --> E[Demo Ready]
```

**Use Case:** "Build a quick demo of the user dashboard"

**Team Composition:** PM + Senior Full-Stack Developer

**Timeline:** 1-3 days

**Process:**
1. **Requirement Gathering (30 minutes)**
   - PM clarifies scope and demo objectives
   - Defines success criteria and constraints
   - Identifies key features to demonstrate

2. **Rapid Development (80% of time)**
   - Developer focuses on core functionality
   - Minimal styling, maximum functionality
   - Quick iterations with PM feedback

3. **Basic Testing (15% of time)**
   - PM performs acceptance testing
   - Developer fixes critical issues only
   - QA involved only for major concerns

4. **Demo Preparation (5% of time)**
   - PM prepares demo script
   - Developer ensures stable deployment
   - Documentation for handoff if needed

## ðŸ”„ Feature Development Workflows
