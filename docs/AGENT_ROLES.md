## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Hub-and-Spoke Communication
```
       PM (Hub)
      /    |    \
   Dev1   QA   DevOps
```
- All technical communication flows through Project Manager
- Reduces n² communication complexity
- Ensures coordinated decision making

### Direct Collaboration (When Appropriate)
```
Frontend Dev ←→ Backend Dev
     ↓              ↓
    QA  ←--------→  QA
```
- Technical discussions between specialists
- Code reviews and pair programming
- Emergency bug fixes and hotfixes

### Escalation Hierarchy
```
Orchestrator
     ↑
Project Manager
     ↑
Team Members
```
- Issues escalate upward when blocked >10 minutes
- Decision authority flows downward
- Clear accountability at each level

## Agent Deployment Strategies

### Small Project (1-3 weeks)
- 1 Senior Developer + 1 Project Manager
- PM handles QA and coordination duties
- Direct communication between PM and Developer

### Medium Project (1-3 months)
- 1 Project Manager + 2 Developers + 1 QA Engineer
- Specialized roles with clear boundaries
- Hub-and-spoke communication pattern

### Large Project (3+ months)
- 1 Project Manager + 3+ Developers + 1 QA + 1 DevOps + 1 Code Reviewer
- Sub-teams by feature area (Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure)
- Matrix organization with cross-functional coordination

### Multi-Project Portfolio
- 1 Orchestrator + Multiple Project Managers
- Shared specialists (DevOps, Security, Research)
- Cross-project knowledge sharing protocols
